## Community Health Files

This repo contains all of my GitHub [default community health files](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization).

GitHub supports auto-linking to this files in an *organization* but not in my personal repos. However if that's every supported in the future the `.github` repo name should enable it for me. At the moment I just copy these files manually into each of my repos and update them manually as well. Some repos may have their own versions of each of these files.

Note that this repo is also open to contribution if you feel any of these community health files could be improved.

## Templates

The repo also contains some default files that I use when creating new repos.
